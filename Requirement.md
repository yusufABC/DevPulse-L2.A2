## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Technology | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | LTS runtime (24.x or higher) |
| TypeScript | use latest version, dont use beta version |
| Express.js | Modular router architecture |
| PostgreSQL | Relational database, native `pg` driver only |
| Raw SQL | Direct `pool.query()` calls, absolutely no query builders, ORMs, or SQL JOINs |
| bcrypt | Password hashing, salt rounds between 8 and 12 |
| jsonwebtoken | JWT generation & verification (standard tokens) |

---

## 👥 User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Allowed Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **contributor** | • Register and log in<br>• Create new issues (bug or feature request)<br>• View all issues<br>• Update own issue field |
| **maintainer** | • All contributor permissions<br>• Update any issue field<br>• Delete any issue<br>• Change issue workflow status independently<br>|

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization System

- **JWT Flow:** Client sends credentials → Server validates & hashes/compares → Server returns signed JWT → Client attaches token to `Authorization: <token>` header → Server verifies signature & expiry before processing.
- **Security Rules:**
    - Passwords are never exposed in responses or logs.
    - Protected endpoints reject requests without a valid JWT.
    - Role verification occurs before privileged operations.

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

### Table 1: `users`

| Field | Requirement (Plain Text) |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each account |
| `name` | Full display name of the team member, must be provided |
| `email` | Valid login address, must be unique across all accounts, must be provided |
| `password` | Encrypted string stored securely, must be provided during registration, never returned in responses |
| `role` | Determines system access level, defaults to `contributor`, must be `contributor` or `maintainer` |
| `created_at` | Timestamp marking when the account was created, automatically generated on insert |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp marking when the account was last updated, automatically refreshed on update |

### Table 2: `issues`

| Field | Requirement (Plain Text) |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each reported item |
| `title` | Short descriptive headline, must be provided, maximum 150 characters |
| `description` | Detailed explanation of the problem or suggestion, must be provided, minimum 20 characters |
| `type` | Categorizes the entry, must be either `bug` or `feature_request` |
| `status` | Current workflow state, defaults to `open`. Status must be one of: `open`, `in_progress`, `resolved` |
| `reporter_id` | References the user who submitted the issue (no foreign key constraint required; validate in application logic) |
| `created_at` | Timestamp marking when the issue was created, automatically generated on insert |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp marking when the issue was last updated, automatically refreshed on update |

    "updated_at": "2026-01-20T09:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

### 2. User Login

**Access:** Public

**Description:** Authenticate user and receive JWT token

**Endpoint**

`POST /api/auth/login`

**Request Body**

}
```

**Success Response (200 OK)**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@devpulse.com",
      "role": "contributor",

}
```

> 💡 **Hint:** When signing the JWT during login, include the user's `id`, `name`, and `role` in the token payload. These fields will be needed later to identify the requester and enforce permissions.

### 🔹 Issues Module

### 3. Create Issue

**Access:** Authenticated users (`contributor`, `maintainer`)

**Description:** Create a new bug report or feature request

**Endpoint**

`POST /api/issues`

**Headers**

```
Authorization: <JWT_TOKEN>
```

  "description": "Pool exhausts after 50+ concurrent queries, causing 500 errors",
  "type": "bug"
}
```

**Success Response (201 Created)**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Issue created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 45,
    "title": "Database connection timeout under load",
    "description": "Pool exhausts after 50+ concurrent queries, causing 500 errors",

### 4. Get All Issues

**Access:** Public

**Description:** Retrieve all issues with optional sorting and filtering

**Endpoint**

`GET /api/issues?sort=newest`

**Query Parameters (`let’s take a challenge`)**

| --- | --- | --- |
| `sort` | `newest`, `oldest` | `newest` |
| `type` | `bug`, `feature_request` | (none) |
| `status` | `open`, `in_progress`, `resolved` | (none) |

**Success Response (200 OK)**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Issues retrived successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 45,

## 🚨 Common Response Patterns

**Standard Success Response Structure**

```json

```

**Standard Error Response Structure**

```json
{

  "errors": "Error details"
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes**

*(Tip: Use the [`http-status-codes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes) package for consistent status code references)*

| Code | Reason Phrase | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | OK | Successful GET, PATCH, PUT, DELETE |
| `201` | Created | Successful POST (resource created) |
| `204` | No Content | Successful DELETE with no response body |
| `400` | Bad Request | Validation errors, invalid input, duplicate resource |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing, expired, or invalid JWT token |
| `403` | Forbidden | Valid token but insufficient role/permissions |
| `404` | Not Found | Requested resource does not exist |
| `409` | Conflict | Business logic conflict (e.g., editing resolved issue) |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server or database error |

## 🎤 Technical Interview Video (Answer Any 2)

**Questions:**

1. How does the Node.js event loop execute asynchronous tasks without blocking the single main thread?
2. What is the purpose of `next()` in Express middleware, and what happens if it is omitted in a route handler?
3. How do you create a centralized error-handling middleware in Express to safely catch both sync and async errors?
4. What are the main differences between SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) regarding schema design and scaling?
5. What is database connection pooling in PostgreSQL, and why is it preferred over opening a new client connection for every request?

**🎤 Recording Instructions:**

- Use your smartphone selfie camera or laptop webcam in **landscape (horizontal) mode**.
- Record in a **well-lit, quiet room** with your **face fully visible** throughout the video.
- Select and answer **any 2 questions** from the list above, spoken in **English**.
- Keep each answer between **3–5 minutes**. Speak naturally from your understanding — avoid reading verbatim from notes or scripts.
- Upload your video to **Google Drive**, **YouTube (Unlisted)**, or any cloud platform, and share a **publicly accessible link**.

## 📬 Submission Guidelines

### 1️⃣ Codebase Requirements

**Architecture & Code Quality:**

- Use **modular architecture**: separate `modules/`, `utils/`, `config/`, and `middleware/` directories
- Create **reusable utility functions** for common tasks (response formatting, error handling, SQL queries)
- Follow the **DRY principle**: avoid code duplication; extract shared logic into helpers
- Keep code **clean and readable**: meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, inline comments for complex logic
- Use **TypeScript strictly**: no `any` types, proper interfaces for request/response bodies

**Critical Requirement:**
⚠️ **You must follow the `API Endpoints Specification` exactly**—including endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request body structure, and response format. Deviations will result in **0 marks**.

---

### 2️⃣ Deployment Requirements

- Deploy backend to **Vercel**, **Render**, or **Railway**
- Use **NeonDB**, **Supabase**, or **ElephantSQL** for PostgreSQL
- Ensure CORS and environment variables are properly configured

[**README.md](http://readme.md/) must include:**

- Project name, live URL, features, tech stack
- Setup steps, API endpoint list, database schema summary
- Keep it clear and professional
